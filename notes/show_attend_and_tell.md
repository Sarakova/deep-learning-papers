# Show, attend and tell: Neural image caption generation with visual attention

</br>

### Contribution

They proposed a novel neural network model that selects adaptively relevant parts of the image while it generates a caption.

They validate the use of attention with state-of-theart performance on three benchmark datasets: Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS COCO.
