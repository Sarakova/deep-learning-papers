# Show, attend and tell: Neural image caption generation with visual attention

</br>

### Contribution

They proposed a novel attention based image caption generator(CNN-RNN architecture) that selects adaptively relevant parts of the image while it generates a caption.

They validate the use of attention mechanism with state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS COCO.
