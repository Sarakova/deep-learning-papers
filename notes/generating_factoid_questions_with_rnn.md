# Generating Factoid Questions With Recurrent Neural Networks: The 30M Factoid Question-Answer Corpus

### Motivation

To this day, there are no large-scale question-answer corpora available. 

### Contributions

They present the 30M Factoid Question-Answer Corpus, an enormous question answer pair corpus produced by applying a novel neural network
architecture on the knowledge base Freebase.
